# Shadow Box Clubhouse Game
Learning PySide6 - Individual Project

## Introduction
This is a simple game called Shadow Box Clubhouse. The program is coded completely in Python using PySide6. The real-life game involves two players, one swiping their hand, and the other moving their head. The objective is for the head-movement player to avoid making the same move as the hand-movement player.

## How to Play
 Use the directional buttons provided (Up, Down, Left, Right) to make your head movements. Mickey(computer) will also make a move simultaneously. If you make the same move as Mickey, the game ends. Otherwise, you continue playing. The game window displays the amount of moves, and what moves each player has made.
